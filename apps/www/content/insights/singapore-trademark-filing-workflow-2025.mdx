## Introduction

Trademark filing in Singapore is getting faster, more digitised, and more client-facing.  
But many firms still operate with workflows designed for a slower, manual world.

This article offers a quick self-audit of your current TM process—and what to upgrade before 2025 makes your internal systems feel obsolete.

## Why Filing is No Longer “Back Office” Work

In recent years, IPOS has streamlined filings, shortened timelines, and gone fully digital.

Clients—especially startups and SMEs—now expect:
- Clear class strategy _before_ filing
- Pre-emptive analysis of potential objections
- Transparent updates and turnaround speed

Trademark filing is no longer just about compliance. It’s now part of client experience, brand strategy, and responsiveness.

## Common Workflow Bottlenecks in Law Firms Today

Even in experienced firms, we still see these pain points slowing down TM advice:

- **Manual Class Recommendations**  
  Still done through checklists or copied from past filings. No clear rationale. Slow for clients.

- **Delayed Searches for Identical Marks**  
  IPOS database is free and fast. Yet teams often wait until the actual filing stage.

- **Non-Standardised Filing Advice**  
  TM letters vary by associate. Clients get inconsistent recommendations—especially in routine industries.

- **Objection Handling is Reactive**  
  Objections (like descriptiveness or similarity) only addressed once received—rather than flagged early.

- **Filing Forms Are Drafted From Scratch**  
  Paralegals manually copy-paste from old Word documents, increasing error risk.

- **No Clear Ownership of Workflow**  
  Admins, paralegals, juniors, and partners all touch the process—but no one owns the full lifecycle.

## What a 2025-Ready Workflow Looks Like

A modern Singapore TM team should aim for:

- ✅ **Class Selection Templates + Decision Trees**  
  Pre-approved logic by industry (e.g. fintech, skincare, F&B)  
  → Faster and more consistent advice.

- ✅ **Instant Identical Mark Checks**  
  Run a quick IPOS search at enquiry stage.  
  → Saves time and flags potential rejections upfront.

- ✅ **Standardised TM Advisory Letters**  
  Same structure, tailored language.  
  → Builds credibility and scales well.

- ✅ **Pre-Objection Risk Review**  
  Flag descriptiveness or similarity _before_ filing.  
  → Fewer delays. Better client conversations.

- ✅ **Pre-Filled Filing Forms**  
  Use internal scripts or tools to auto-complete TM4, TM27, and more.  
  → Saves time and reduces clerical mistakes.

- ✅ **Clear Workflow Ownership**  
  Assign one team member or pod to manage each matter end-to-end.  
  → Cuts confusion and bottlenecks.

## Preparing Your Team for the Next Leap

To prepare for a faster, client-first TM world:

- Upskill junior staff in class logic and TM search techniques
- Review SOPs: do they match what your clients expect in 2025?
- Consider lightweight tools that streamline class picking, mark checking, and early-stage advisory
- Schedule mock audits: simulate a client query and track your intake-to-filing turnaround

## Conclusion: Filing Isn’t Slower—We Are

IPOS is moving fast. Clients are moving faster.  
The bottlenecks are now internal.

Law firms that rethink and streamline their TM processes—not just their headcount—will thrive.

Whether you’re a boutique TM agent or full-service firm, updating your workflow isn’t just about tech.  
It’s about staying relevant in a legal landscape where _filing is client service_.
