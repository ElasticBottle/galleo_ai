The Ministry of Law (MinLaw) and the Law Society of Singapore have issued new guidelines on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in legal practice. While the guidelines address concerns around data security and ethical responsibility, they also underscore a broader reality—AI is becoming indispensable to legal work, and law firms must learn how to integrate it effectively.  

Speaking at the launch of the Legal Technology Platform’s Copilot for SG Law Firms, Minister for Culture, Community and Youth and Second Minister for Law Edwin Tong emphasized AI’s growing role in legal work, stating that it is already capable of performing tasks at the level of a junior legal associate, but in a fraction of the time and cost.  

This aligns with global trends. A 2024 Thomson Reuters report estimates that AI could save legal professionals up to 12 hours per week by 2029. These new guidelines do not warn against AI adoption—instead, they ensure that firms implement it the right way.  

## MinLaw’s Guidelines: AI is a Tool, Not a Replacement  

MinLaw’s guidelines reinforce a key message: AI is a fundamental part of the profession’s future, and its responsible adoption in essential in ensuring Singapore's legal industry remains competitive. The focus, far from emphasising restriction of AI usage, is on responsible adoption in three key areas:  

### 1. Data Security & Confidentiality  

Lawyers must ensure that AI tools do not store or expose privileged client information. Public AI models that retain user input should be avoided, and firms are encouraged to use private or secure AI systems to protect sensitive data.  

### 2. Accuracy & Ethical Use  

AI-generated legal content must be verified before use, as AI models can produce misleading or incorrect outputs. Lawyers remain fully accountable for errors in AI-assisted work and should use AI to speed up tasks, not replace professional judgment.  

### 3. AI’s Role in Legal Workflows  

The guidelines do not prohibit AI but stress that it should be implemented with oversight. AI is recognized as an effective tool for legal research, contract analysis, and document drafting, helping firms improve efficiency while maintaining legal standards.  

By issuing these guidelines, MinLaw signals that AI is not just permitted, but expected to become a core part of legal practice—hence the importance of its responsible use.  

## AI is Already Reshaping Legal Workflows in Singapore  

Singapore’s legal industry has already embraced AI-driven tools that reduce administrative burden, improve accuracy, and free up lawyers to focus on complex legal work.  

- **LawNet AI**, launched in September 2024, now provides AI-generated case summaries for over 15,000 unreported judgments, allowing lawyers to analyze case law faster than ever before.  
- **Copilot for SG Law Firms**, developed by MinLaw in partnership with Lupl, integrates AI into document drafting, deadline tracking, and case management, helping firms stay on top of legal tasks more efficiently.  
- Several firms have implemented **AI-powered contract review tools**, which process thousands of agreements in minutes, significantly reducing manual review time.  

These are not experimental projects—they are active, widely used tools that demonstrate how AI is already saving time for legal professionals. The efficiency gains from AI are undeniable, and the new guidelines only reinforce that law firms should integrate AI into their operations while ensuring responsible oversight.  

## Singapore Law Firms Must Adopt AI or Risk Falling Behind: MinLaw  

Law firms in the United States and United Kingdom are rapidly integrating legaltech to enhance efficiency and service delivery. Singapore cannot afford to fall behind. Minister Tong underscored this urgency, stating that to compete with law firms in other countries, Singapore lawyers must also keep an open mindset and embrace legaltech.

With legal research, document automation, and case management already benefiting from AI tools, MinLaw’s guidelines make it clear: the question is not whether firms should use AI, but how quickly they can integrate it into their operations.  

For law firms handling high volumes of filings, AI can already automate key processes, reduce manual errors, and streamline operations. Platforms like [Galleo](https://galleo.ai), which specializes in AI-driven trademark filing automation, provide firms with a practical way to reduce repetitive administrative work while ensuring accuracy and compliance. By integrating AI into filing workflows, firms can save time, reduce costs, and focus on higher-value legal strategy.  

Firms that adopt AI responsibly will find themselves operating more efficiently, reducing workload bottlenecks, and staying ahead of industry changes. Those that delay may struggle to keep up in an increasingly tech-driven profession.  

## AI is the Future of Legal Work in Singapore  

MinLaw’s AI guidelines reinforce an important shift: AI is no longer an emerging trend—it is a core part of modern legal practice, and it's adoption essential in the future of our legal industry. The focus is not on whether AI should be used, but how firms can implement it in a way that is efficient, ethical, and secure.  

Singapore’s legal industry is already benefiting from AI, and with MinLaw actively shaping its integration, law firms should see this as a strong endorsement of AI’s role in the profession. The firms that move early, implementing AI to handle time-consuming tasks, will be the ones that remain competitive in the years to come.
